3. BucketsSpeedTest

Overall, linked list and PQ are the fastest, array list is also fast. But tree set and hash set are relatively slower.
if we were able to use binary search over the TreeSet and hash search over the HashSet, they are definitely gonna be faster. In fact, hash set could be the fastest.
